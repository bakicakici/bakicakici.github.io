I am an associate professor working at the intersections of science & technology studies (STS), sociology, and computer science at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/). I am part of the [Technologies in Practice](http://tip.itu.dk/) section and the [ETHOS lab](https://ethos.itu.dk/). My research interests include the politics of data, software studies, and identification systems.

Between 2014-2017, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.gold.ac.uk/sociology/) at [Goldsmiths, University of London](http://www.gold.ac.uk/), within the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/) funded research project [Peopling Europe: How data make a people (ARITHMUS)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/615588).

In 2013, I received my [PhD degree](http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A643436) from [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se/english/), [Department of Computer and Systems Sciences](http://dsv.su.se/en/). During my PhD, I was employed by the [Swedish Institute of Computer Science](https://www.ri.se/), and the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (now part of the [Public Health Agency of Sweden](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/)).

In my spare time I row at [Malm√∂ Roddklubb](https://malmoroddklubb.se/), and sometimes I paint [small things](https://www.instagram.com/thenduring/).
