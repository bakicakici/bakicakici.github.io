##### Abstract:
A critical investigation into computational models developed for studying the spread of communicable disease is presented. The case in point is a spatially explicit micro–meso–macro model for the entire Swedish population built on registry data, thus far used for smallpox and for influenza-like illnesses. The lessons learned from a software development project of more than 100 person months are collected into a check list. The list is intended for use by computational epidemiologists and policy makers, and the workflow incorporating these two roles is described in detail.
